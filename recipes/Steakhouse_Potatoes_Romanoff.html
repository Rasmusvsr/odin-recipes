    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>They say what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas, but that's mostly because people just don't remember exactly what happened. Well, the only thing I didn't forget was this special potato gratin that Chef John Schenk taught me how to make 10 years ago at his restaurant Strip House. Not only is it the soul mate of steak, but it's also a great side dish for big holiday gatherings since you can make it the day before and bake when needed.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 teaspoon butter, or as needed                  </li>
            <li>3 large russet potatoes, scrubbed                </li>
            <li>2 shallots                                       </li>
            <li>3 teaspoons kosher salt                          </li>
            <li>½ teaspoon freshly ground white pepper           </li>
            <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste              </li>
            <li>2 ½ cups grated sharp white Cheddar cheese       </li>
            <li>1 ¾ cups sour cream                              </li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Butter a casserole dish.</li>
            <li>Wrap each potato in foil and place on a baking sheet. Poke holes into potatoes using a knife.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until very tender and easily pierced with a knife, about 1 hour and 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Let potatoes cool to room temperature, at least 20 minutes. Unwrap. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until completely chilled, 8 hours to overnight.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Shred potatoes into a large bowl using a cheese grater. Mince shallots to get 1/4 to 1/3 cup.</li>
            <li>Add shallots in with the potatoes; season with salt, white pepper, and cayenne. Toss with two forks until well combined. Add Cheddar cheese and mix well. Gently toss in sour cream until barely combined. Transfer mixture into the prepared baking dish, piling it up high, then patting it down very lightly.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until piping hot and top is browned, 30 to 35 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
